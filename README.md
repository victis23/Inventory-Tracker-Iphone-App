# Print Plus Inventory Tracker
Designed & Developed By: Scott Leonard aka Michael Wells

## What inspired me to create this app.

>The best projects are those rooted in neccesity. 

I never knew I wanted to become a programmer until I ran into a brick wall at work. As the person in charge of keeping inventory at my job I found myself both annoyed and overwhelmed at the disorganized state of affairs. The problem was that the person who actually made inventory purchases was extremely disorganized â€” forgetting to document purchases or simply misplacing our supplier contact list. \
This situation pushed me to seek out a solution. Now, I know what you're thinking; I could have just downloaded an app for inventory management or persuaded my employeers to purchase one, right? \
Well, wrong. That's what the 99% would do. I'm trying to be an exceptional person and so I set out on the task of learning to program.

This is my very first project and I am proud of what I've managed to accomplish with no prior iOS developement experience. All of the artwork, UI, and UX I designed myself using Adobe Illustrator.
