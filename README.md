# Print Plus Inventory Tracker
Designed & Developed By: Scott Leonard aka Michael Wells

Do you work in an office that is constantly using and purchasing paper? Do you have trouble keeping track of how much inventory you have remaining, how much you've spent on a certain item, or when you'll need to purchase more? Well, if this sounds like you, then you're in luck! Inventory Tracker is a robust tracking app that allows you the piece-of-mind of no longer having to struggle keeping track of paper inventory. 

### What It Does

1. Keeps a sorted list of your current inventory where the amounts that need re-purchasing automatically rise to the top of the list based on parameters that you've set up.

2. Puts contact information for each of you suppliers at your fingertips. No more having to google for their phone numbers or address.

3. Provides a built-in paper cut calculator. No more guessing about how many items you can fit on a sheet. Simply type in the size of the raw material and the size of the product and instantly know how much material you'll need to order.

4. Keep track of your spending. Do you want to know how much you've spent on a particular project. Well, you'll no longer need to go rummaging through paperwork. The answer is just a click away!

## What inspired me to create this app.

>The best projects are those rooted in neccesity. 

I never knew I wanted to become a programmer until I ran into a brick wall at work. As the person in charge of keeping inventory at my job I found myself both annoyed and overwhelmed at the disorganized state of affairs. The problem was that the person who actually made inventory purchases was extremely disorganized â€” forgetting to document purchases or simply misplacing our supplier contact list. \
This situation pushed me to seek out a solution. Now, I know what you're thinking; I could have just downloaded an app for inventory management or persuaded my employeers to purchase one, right? \
Well, wrong. That's what the 99% would do. I'm trying to be an exceptional person and so I set out on the task of learning to program.

This is my very first project and I am proud of what I've managed to accomplish with no prior iOS developement experience. All of the artwork, UI, and UX I designed myself using Adobe Illustrator.
